# Game of Life

A Game of Life implementation in Ruby. It consists of the following classes:

* `World` — Represents an evolving world with retrieval of beings.
* `Being` — Represents a sentient being with state.
* `Life` — Represents life at a given coordinate within a world.

## Install

The application uses Ruby 3.0, and dependencies can be install by running:

```shell
bundle install
```

## Quality

Code meets RuboCop's default recommendations, including all new cops.

## Tests

100% test coverage, measured with SimpleCov — via a high level test in `test/world_test.rb`. Additional unit testing of individual classes would be preferable.

```shell
rake test
```

Note that coverage output will be available in a `coverage` folder after running the tests.

## Usage

There is a sample shell script which can be run with:

```shell
./script/run
```
